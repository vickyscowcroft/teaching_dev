Hello,

Attached you'll find the notebook (and data) I have been using for a template for Python graph plotting. 
* If you want to improve this notebook please do.

Also, a pdf of the Python course work I've been working on. It has more examples of the type of graphs I'm after (I made those ones in Matlab - I'm bad). I've also attached the Excel data file that the course-work is based on. The yellow bits on the pdf are the only bits of the Latex file that the students need changed.
* If you wanted to see if you get the same yellow-bits answers but based on your Python skills that would be great!!
* I can send you the template .tex file tonight if you wished.
Also attached is the up-to-date lab booklet. It has the now up to date stats section, and under "assessment A5" the actual instructions of the course-work.
* This is just sent for completeness. If you sport any errors etc. please do highlight.


or do nothing, that is also good!

Pete
